<< About >>  
 
This program provides a gui for viewing NBT (Named Binary Tag) data generated by  
Minecraft, namely level.dat and *.mcr and *.mca region files, as a dump of raw  
text.  
 
Originally used to simply see if I could write a program to correctly read  
Minecraft save files, the code used in this program aided the development of  
what eventually became Biome Painter (https://github.com/mblaine/BiomePainter).  
 
Always a crude and simple program I've quickly redesigned it to be at least a  
little user friendly. Hopefully it could be a little bit useful in viewing the  
contents of Minecraft save files while working on other Minecraft tools.
